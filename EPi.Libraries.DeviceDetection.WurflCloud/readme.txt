wurfl cloud device detection service for use with EPi.Libraries.DeviceDetection.

Don't forget to add an AppSetting "wurfl:apikey" with your key.
If you have the full version add an AppSetting "wurfl:fullversion", value "true".

NOTE: Check your references after installing. The Wurfl Cloud API package adds a reference to a  NewtonSoft.JSON dll, a version that is included with the package, which you probably don't want.
